# My Tutorial

## Step 1

Hello Westminster!    
You should write some code in Minecraft you know.
```blocks
blocks.place(GRASS, pos(0,0,0))
```

```blocks
mobs.spawn(CHICKEN, pos(0, 0, 0))
```

## Step 2

```template
player.onChat("hello", function () {
    agent.move(SixDirection.Forward, 1)
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.Right)
    agent.place(SixDirection.Back)
})
```

This is step 2, time for more coding!

## Step 3

You win the game!
